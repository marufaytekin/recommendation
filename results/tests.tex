50. User-based: Run  this test to select best k for data set with cross validation. (use val data sets)

51. User-based: Run this test for k and y 2D test to detect if there is a correlation between k and y values. (use val datasets)

54. UB-LSH: Run this test 2D test to detect if there is a correlation between HashFunctions and k. (use val data sets)

55. UB-LSH: Run this test 2D test to detect if there is a correlation between HashFunctions and y. (Use best k value from test 54 and val data sets).

60. UB-LSH: Run this test 2D test to detect if there is a correlation between HashTables and k. (use val data sets, and HashFunctions and y from 54 and 55)

61. UB-LSH: Run this test 2D test to detect if there is a correlation between HashTables and y. (Use best k value from test 54 and val data sets)

59. Use the best k and y values from (54, 55) and run this test to find out how HashFunctions and Tables effect accuracy. (use val sets) Used k = 20 and y = 5

56. Select best HashFunctions from 59 then run this test to see prediction accuracy and HashTables change. (use test data sets)

57. Select best  HashTables from 59 and run this test to see prediction accuracy and HashFunctions change. (use test data sets)

58. Run this test with optimum HashFunctions and HashTables set to see the effect of increasing k on accuracy.

72. UB-LSH: Run this test to see relationship between k and HashFunctions

73. UB-LSH: Run this test to see relationship between k and HashTables


Test 51:

We run 2D tests for UB prediction and found out how k and y changes effect User-based accuracy (MAE).
from ml-mae-k-y-runtime-heat-map.eps we see that y and k are independent from each other. If we select k too low or y too high that will decrease the accuracy. We will use these values for user-based tests. Note that y decreases MAE until around 7 then MAE starts to increase.

k and y have different effect on LSH. based algorithms.

Test 54:
We run 2D tests for UB-LSH to find out how k and Hash Functions effect the accuracy. We found out that accuracy is best for this data set when k is about about 15-20  and  HashFunctions about 4. We set k=20 for the rest of UBLSH tests of this data set.
On the other hand increasing number of hash functions effects accuracy in better way when k is too low.



Test 55:

We set k = 20 and run 2D tests to see how y and HashFunctions change effect accuracy for UB-LSH. Increasing y increases error as well as increasing HashFunctions.
When we increase the number of hash functions increasing y has negative effect on the accuracy
('test-55-ml-mae-lsh-y-hash-functions'). We need to keep y as low as possible (around 5) for LSH tests. We will set HashFunctions to 4 and run the next tests.

Test 60: optimum k is around 20

Test 61: optimum y is around 5.

Test 59: Use optimum k and y and run 2D UBLSH test for lower and upper bounds of HashTables/Functions

Test 56-57: These results can be retreived from test: 59.
