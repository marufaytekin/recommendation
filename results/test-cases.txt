50. User-based: Run  this test to select best k for data set with cross validation. (use val data sets)

51. User-based: Run this test for k and y 2D test to detect if there is a correlation between k and y values. (use val datasets)

54. UB-LSH: Run this test 2D test to detect if there is a correlation between HashFunctions and k. (use val data sets) performs best when k is about 15-20. On the other hand increasing number of hash functions effects accuracy in better way when k is too low.

55. UB-LSH: Run this test 2D test to detect if there is a correlation between HashFunctions and y. (Use best k value from test 54 and val data sets).  When we increase the number of hash functions increasing y has negative effect on the accuracy ('test-55-ml-mae-lsh-y-hash-functions'). We need to keep y as low as possible (around 5) for LSH tests.

60. UB-LSH: Run this test 2D test to detect if there is a correlation between HashTables and k. (use val data sets, and HashFunctions and y from 54 and 55) (optimum k is around 20)

61. UB-LSH: Run this test 2D test to detect if there is a correlation between HashTables and y. (Use best k value from test 54 and val data sets) optimum y is around 5.

59. Use the best k and y values from (54, 55) and run this test to find out how HashFunctions and Tables effect accuracy. (use val sets) Used k = 20 and y = 5

56. Select best HashFunctions from 59 then run this test to see prediction accuracy and HashTables change. (use test data sets)

57. Select best  HashTables from 59 and run this test to see prediction accuracy and HashFunctions change. (use test data sets)

72. UB-LSH: Run this test to see relationship between k and HashFunctions

73. UB-LSH: Run this test to see relationship between k and HashTables
